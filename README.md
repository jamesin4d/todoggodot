iterating FPS game prototyping. 
i'm working on it, DAMN IT! i hate having so many responsibilities when all i want to do is make games for those responsibilities.
make games for a job is what i mean. anyways, i'm working through this godot tutorial to build the basics for an fps. once i've gotten through 
i'll be recreating many of the assets to learn how it's done and replace the tutorial pieces with those of my own. while this goes on, i probably won't update
this repo but leave it here as a placeholder for the project to come. this is all mostly for my own posterity anyways.
